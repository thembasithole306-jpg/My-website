        <p>Hey!</p>

        <p>I don’t even know if you’ll respond to this, <br>
        Or even bother to read it, at least. <br>
        Because lately our eyes hold different worlds, different iris, <br>
        And somewhere along the way, one of us became a beast.</p>

        <p>A beast that swings in the dark, blind, <br>
        Strong enough to destroy without a clue, <br>
        Shattering everything that once felt kind, <br>
        Like it was never loved, like none of it was true.</p>

        <p>They say strength is never crying, <br>
        But silence turns the heart into a grave, <br>
        Holding it in feels like slowly dying, <br>
        And every lie becomes a wave.</p>

        <p>I remember how we laughed together, <br>
        Under warm skies and perfect weather, <br>
        I felt lighter than any feather, <br>
        Dreaming a future we built together.</p>

        <p>And that joy felt real to me, <br>
        Nothing about it seemed snappy, <br>
        My whole body reacted in a daze, <br>
        Not knowing why my chest felt so happy.</p>

        <p>My friends swore the signs meant something, <br>
        And I was innocent enough to believe, <br>
        Until you stopped the one thing that kept us running, loving, <br>
        Leaving me sliced and salted like meat you cleave.</p>

        <p>I questioned myself, "What did I do?", <br>
        For you to shift so fast, become so cold, <br>
        You changed out of nowhere, out of the blue, <br>
        And masked your heart behind a lie you sold.</p>

        <p>So I dug, followed every clue, <br>
        Because answers matter when pain knocks louder, <br>
        Found out a spare wheel only matters with a puncture too, <br>
        But honestly, I had sensed the disaster.</p>

        <p>Now I know how it feels to be loved by lips, not actions, <br>
        While someone else takes center stage, <br>
        I was just a filler in your life's distractions, <br>
        You called me air, but he became the whole sky’s page.</p>

        <p>You thought your secrets were sealed tight, <br>
        Safe inside darkness like a hidden cave, <br>
        Until I said, “Don’t think I was born last night, <br>
        I know about you and John, the love you gave.”</p>

        <p>You feared I’d hurt you, feared a swing, <br>
        But I had no intention to harm or fight, <br>
        ’Cause when you cheated, you had a ring, <br>
        Your own choice, your own light.</p>

        <p>No wonder we stopped seeing eye to eye, <br>
        No wonder your voice could not say hi, <br>
        Your eyes forgot me long before, <br>
        That’s why I finally showed you the door.</p>

        <p>I never wanted revenge or score, <br>
        I simply chose myself over war, <br>
        I know my worth, <br>
        It’s been in me since birth.</p>

        <p>My mother raised a gentleman, <br>
        A man who handles fire like a fireman, <br>
        I don’t know what you saw in that other guy, <br>
        But one thing’s certain, <strong>your loss, not mine.</strong></p>
