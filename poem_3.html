      <p>Hey!</p>

      <p>I don't even know if you will respond to this,<br>
      Or to even try to read it at least,<br>
      Because lately we have different wholes, iris,<br>
      I could swear one of us turned to a beast.</p>

      <p>A beast that attacks but it's blind,<br>
      Beast so strong, all it knows is to destroy,<br>
      Crushing everything like it was never once kind,<br>
      Like it was never loved and like it didn't enjoy.</p>

      <p>Said to be strong, never cries,<br>
      But what not crying does to one onside, dies,<br>
      One thing that can send someone deep to boil like fries,<br>
      That will definitely be lies.</p>

      <p>I remember how we were happy together,<br>
      under sunny day favored even by the weather,<br>
      never felt so light like a feather,<br>
      Planned the future together.</p>

      <p>And that made me happy,<br>
      Never even thought everything was snappy,<br>
      Caught all the body hair raise,<br>
      Didn't understand what was going on when I gazed.</p>

      <p>My friends told me it meant something,<br>
      And I was stupid enough to believe them,<br>
      Till you stopped one thing that had us together, Loving,<br>
      You used me and left me pressed and salted like a ham.</p>

      <p>I asked myself, what did I do?<br>
      For you to change all of a sudden, to treat me so bad,<br>
      Because you changed out of the blue,<br>
      You never saw me cry, because we are taught that a man never shows when sad.</p>

      <p>Then I got a word out and investigated,<br>
      Found out that you cannot use a spare wheel, if you don't have a puncture (Flat tire),<br>
      But all this was predicted,<br>
      I applauded myself I was like a hunter.</p>

      <p>So now I knew what it feels like to be loved by words and not actions,<br>
      So you found yourself another guy,<br>
      I was just one of the distractions,<br>
      You said I was your air, I guess he is the whole sky.</p>

      <p>You thought your secret was safe,<br>
      All along you thought you were in a cave,<br>
      Until I said "don't think I was just born,<br>
      I know about you and John."</p>

      <p>You were scared that I might hurt you,<br>
      But I had a different view,<br>
      Cos when you cheated you had one too,<br>
      So I'll rather not disturb you two.</p>

      <p>No wonder we didn't see eye to eye,<br>
      When you saw me, you couldn't even say hi,<br>
      I guess you have an eye that didn't see me anymore,<br>
      That's why I decided to point to you the door.</p>

      <p>I never wanted to settle the score,<br>
      I chose myself over war,<br>
      I know my worth,<br>
      Known that since birth.</p>

      <p>Mother raised a gentleman,<br>
      That knows how to deal with fire like a fireman,<br>
      I don't know what you saw in the other guy,<br>
      But I can say it is your loss, not mine.</p>
