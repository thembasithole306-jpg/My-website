    <p>Hey!<p>

    <p>This poem won’t be going to you.<br>
    I guess it’s like a little note to self.<br>
    It’s time I become true,<br>
    Take the books off the shelf.</p>

    <p>It’s been long; they are even dusty.<br>
    I was lost in the act of “love.”<br>
    Even metal decays and gets rusty;<br>
    Nothing stays forever, except the one above.</p>

    <p>I wished our bond could be forever,<br>
    Because being with you was always better.<br>
    Yet life has its ways, however<br>
    No one knows the future, no man is that clever.</p>

    <p>We shared love so true;<br>
    Every day all I thought about was you.<br>
    Time we spent together—quality,<br>
    I never knew one of us lacked honesty.</p>

    <p>You stayed with me for what I offered,<br>
    Not for the heart or love.<br>
    Then, in a blink, you left like water,<br>
    Evaporating in the sun, rising like a dove.</p>

    <p>You tried to pin all this on me;<br>
    When they asked, you said, “ask him.”<br>
    Chasing the green, all about the tree,<br>
    I never thought I’d be left in the dim.</p>

    <p>Your friends believed I was to blame,<br>
    All under your control like pawns in a game.<br>
    Now they hold hate,<br>
    But for me it carried no weight.</p>

    <p>You turned them all against,<br>
    Well, that’s what you thought.<br>
    Overthinking every move, all this was sensed<br>
    We reached a tie—a knot.</p>

    <p>I had to cut all ties,<br>
    Because I told you countless times I hate lies.<br>
    By all ties, I meant everything connected to you,<br>
    So I could stay with only what’s true.</p>

    <p>Clearly, you were the rotten potato,<br>
    And it affects the whole bag.<br>
    You were even happy to see me low,<br>
    Your head full of air, like an airbag.</p>

    <p>You thought you pulled me down,<br>
    But in reality, you were the clown.<br>
    You hated me for not giving my card,<br>
    Damn, girl, your life must have been hard.</p>

    <p>You threw dirt, trying to kill me,<br>
    But you grew a wildflower instead.<br>
    Setting me free,<br>
    Like water running after a long day—a shower.</p>

    <p>You thought you were the prize,<br>
    But you were just a salty spice.<br>
    Now that you are gone, life feels nice,<br>
    Like a soft drink on a hot day with ice.</p>

    <p>Since you left,<br>
    I feel something lifted from my back—a knife.<br>
    I survived the wildlife,<br>
    Turned shelf-life into real life.</p>

    <p>A piece of advice to myself and all who read:<br>
    Know your worth, don’t stay where you’ll end up broken.<br>
    Love may hurt, but it was never meant to kill.<br>
    Love is not perfect, yet it conquers all when hearts are true.<br>
    When they don’t love you, leave, because you deserve more.</p>
