      <p>Hey!<br><br>
      This poem won't be going to you<br>
      I guess it's like a little note to self<br>
      I guess it's time I become true,<br>
      Take the books out of the shelf.</p>

      <p>It's been long now, they are even dusty<br>
      I guess I was lost in the act of "Love"<br>
      Even metal decays over time and gets rusty<br>
      Nothing stays forever like the one above.</p>

      <p>But I wished our bond could be forever<br>
      Because being with you was always better<br>
      Than this feeling of being apart, however<br>
      No one knows the future - no man is that clever.</p>

      <p>We shared love so true<br>
      Everyday all I thought about was you<br>
      Time we spent together - Quality<br>
      I never knew one of us lacked honesty.</p>

      <p>You stayed with me, because of what I offered<br>
      Not because of the love<br>
      In a nick of time you left like water<br>
      Getting hit by the sun and rising like a dove (Evaporation)</p>

      <p>You tried to pin all this on me<br>
      When they asked, you said "ask him"<br>
      Because you were chasing the green, all about the tree<br>
      I never thought I was in the dim.</p>

      <p>Your friends believed I was the one to blame<br>
      They were all under your control like in a game<br>
      Now they are all at hate<br>
      But I don't care so their hate doesn't have weight.</p>

      <p>You turned all of them against<br>
      Well that's what you thought<br>
      I am an overthinker, so all this was sensed<br>
      We reached a point of a tie - a knot.</p>

      <p>I had to cut all ties<br>
      Because I told you countless times that I hate lies<br>
      By all ties I meant everything that connects with you<br>
      So that I stay with only what's true.</p>

      <p>Clearly you were the rotten potato<br>
      But it's sad because it affects the whole bag<br>
      You were even happy to see me low<br>
      Your brain was full of air like an airbag.</p>

      <p>You thought you pulled me down<br>
      But in reality, you were the clown<br>
      You hate me with all your heart for not giving you my card<br>
      Damn girl your life must have been hard.</p>

      <p>You threw dirt on me, trying to kill me<br>
      But you didn't know you grew a wildflower<br>
      And actually, setting me free<br>
      Felt very nice like water running in the body after a long day - Shower.</p>

      <p>You thought you were the prize<br>
      But you were just a salty spice<br>
      Now that you are no longer here life feels nice<br>
      Like a soft drink on a hot day with ice.</p>

      <p>Since you left my life<br>
      I feel like something has been pulled out of my back - a knife<br>
      I really survived a wildlife<br>
      Turned a shelf-life to real-life.</p>

      <p>This is a piece of advice to myself and everyone reading this poem<br>
      Know your worth and don't stay where you will end up broken<br>
      Love may hurt but I was never meant to kill<br>
      Love is not perfect but it conquers all when all are in love<br>
      Not one way<br>
      When they don't love you, leave because you deserve more.</p>
