            <p>Hey!<br><br>
            I’m writing this not because I want to,<br>
            But because my chest is heavy<br>
            And every time I breathe,<br>
            Something inside me turns and twists<br>
            Like a knife being pushed slowly.</p>

            <p>You said forever—<br>
            And I believed you.<br>
            Not because you were perfect,<br>
            But because your voice felt warm<br>
            And your eyes looked honest.</p>

            <p>I guess I should have known that<br>
            Humans lie even when they don’t mean to.<br>
            Love fades even when it feels strong.<br>
            And hearts break quietly<br>
            Long before the final goodbye.</p>

            <p>I tried, I swear I did.<br>
            I held every piece together<br>
            Even when they were cutting me.<br>
            But you let go first,<br>
            And everything fell apart after.</p>

            <p>Now I’m here, writing this,<br>
            Not to make you feel bad,<br>
            But to free myself<br>
            From the weight of pretending<br>
            That I’m still whole.</p>
