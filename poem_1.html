    <h1>Poem 1</h1>
    <p>
        Wrapped around with chains, I feel the weight,<br>
        Memories of you, I cannot negate.<br>
        I gave you a name, imagined a life,<br>
        Only to face the pain, the endless strife.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        My head aches, migraines sting,<br>
        I lost a game I didn’t choose to bring.<br>
        A crane is needed to lift this load,<br>
        Yet here I stand, alone on this road.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I see our past, laughter and tears,<br>
        Dreams we shared across the years.<br>
        Now only echoes remain in the night,<br>
        Heartbreak lingers, out of sight.<br>
    </p>
