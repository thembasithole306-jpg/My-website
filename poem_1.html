    <h1>Poem 1</h1>

    <p>
        Hey!<br><br>

        It's me again<br>
        The reason I am writing this is because I have no one else but myself to blame<br>
        Since you left, my chest feels heavy, my heart wrapped in chains<br>
        To remove this weight, I feel I’ll need a crane.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        When I planned the future, you were always in the frame<br>
        I know it sounds insane, but your image lives in my brain<br>
        I even gave you a nickname, thinking it would forever remain<br>
        It felt like I was high on something I couldn’t explain<br>
        A rush I couldn’t restrain, a storm I couldn’t contain<br>
        And it’s funny how you forgot my name, as if I never existed.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        And when you said you can’t<br>
        My mind erupted like Octane, ten thoughts racing, none clear<br>
        Each choice like lightning striking, each one I fear<br>
        After realizing the decision you took, a sharp pulse hit my head<br>
        A migraine reminding me the future I saw for us had fled<br>
        Dreams of us reaching Mars now float in empty space<br>
        And I’m left tracing the ghost of your face.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I renamed our memory a losing game<br>
        Because I wandered in someone else’s domain<br>
        How can I call it a win when there’s nothing to gain?<br>
        How can I move forward when the past still remains?<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I remember the nights I whispered your name<br>
        My pillow soaked with unshed tears, my soul aflame<br>
        I dreamed of laughter, of sunlit mornings in your eyes<br>
        Now every silent room echoes your goodbye.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        And yet, I cling to the fragments, the small sparks of “us”<br>
        Though they burn in my chest, though the fire turns to dust<br>
        Perhaps one day, these chains will fall<br>
        And I’ll find a way to rise, to stand tall.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        But tonight, I write<br>
        Because the pain is too loud to keep inside<br>
        And even if no one reads these words<br>
        They carry my heart, raw, unbroken, wide.<br>
    </p>
