            <h2>Ecoes of the soul</h2>

   
            <p>Hey!</p>

            <p>Yeah, I know, I know</p>

            <p>It’s me again<br>
            Don’t worry, I am not writing in pain<br>
            Ever since I met you, I don’t know how that feels<br>
            There’s this constant motion inside me, like spinning wheels</p>

            <p>What I mean is that it never stops<br>
            It keeps turning, climbing, rising, it hops<br>
            It makes time want to pause, reality bends<br>
            Each heartbeat a question, every glance transcends</p>

            <p>No feeling has been greater than this<br>
            Kept on going up like an elevator’s bliss<br>
            Got my head spun around like an operator<br>
            Mind and heart agreed: all we see is danger<br>
            Yet it poked my chest, a sly love instigator<br>
            Everything feels exact, like answers on a calculator</p>

            <p>I still don’t understand how her presence is so strong<br>
            My eyes, my mind, my heart can’t measure for long<br>
            Is she a rainbow? Because she’s vivid and bright<br>
            A treasure, a reminder of life’s pure light<br>
            All I could do was let my eyes capture the view<br>
            And my chest fluttered with every shade, every hue</p>

            <p>I don’t even want to start talking about her face<br>
            The kind that needs no filter, the perfect grace<br>
            Best in the cage — Ace, pristine and serene<br>
            Never seen a face so effortlessly clean</p>

            <p>Ok, let me cut the chase<br>
            Be like a full stop — get straight to the place<br>
            But my heart’s still running a marathon, a race<br>
            Every thought of her feels like a checkpoint to embrace</p>

            <p>And yet, these wheels keep spinning in my chest<br>
            The thrill, the awe, the feeling I can’t rest<br>
            Each glance, each smile, a pulse that won’t fade<br>
            A constant, sweet chaos, a melody she made</p>
